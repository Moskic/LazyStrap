What & Why LazyStrap?
---------------------------
Nothing serious, it's just a fun project on my spare time. If you are lazier than me or just like Jon Snow, know nothing about when you will be able to build your own website, but know how to wield some basic HTML and CSS, this template might hold the door for you.
